Request for the perquisite in connection with the land occupied by government at Enugu

We acknowledge that minerals are the property of the government and that coal forms part of it. Previous the lieutenant-Governor at Enugu made the acknowledge the case of hostilities at Udi and how they subsequently becoming a conquered territory, despite this, we beg to notify his excellency that a place like Benin we conquered but we understand that they control their land to say nothing of the Timbers.

1) The government having taken part of this land for its own use freely should allow us to make leases to firms and others direct as is done in other places such as Calabar, Onitsha etc

2) That having taken the direct leasing of coalfields should share the proceeds with us
3) That in the absence of this, we regard ourselves as not fairly treated

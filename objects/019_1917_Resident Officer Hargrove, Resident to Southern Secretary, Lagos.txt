Hargrove, Resident to Southern Lagos on the 13th of March 1917 submitted a  plan of approximately additional twenty square miles to be acquired by Government at Enugu Colliery and Railway which includes town Ngwo.

Land already acquired about six square miles. Chiefs have apparently heard of additional requirements and are commencing opposition by complaining to me of loss of farming land by last agreement. Paramount chief Onyema of Eke wo urged them to demand 1000 pounds rent in the last agreement is responsible for this opposition.

I may possibly while in position as resident officer of the province be able to obtain agreement additional land if fine at once and if i am authorized to pay compensation up to two thousand pounds would endeavor much less. If I find agreement impossible would not risk definite refusal but will report.

It may be necessary to acquire under ordinance and provincial court fixed compensation but i would propose that you try to obtain agreement if authorized as above. I would ask for reply early as possible.


Hargrove Resident to Southern Lagos, March 22nd 1917.

I have seen Woodburn who is telegraphing to you necessity. After consultation with colliery Manager and Graham, they wish the matter finally settled 

For the moment circumstances have arisen which entirely alter the position of person named in my code telegram and if done immediately possible may secure agreement.

Woodburn has authorized payment to be made by Colliery item 36 300 Pounds Compensation to avoid delay and i will endeavor to arrange with the amount granted by him.

## About the Collection
This collection captures the intertwined narratives of colonial land dispossession and Indigenous resistance in Eastern Nigeria, particularly in coal mining regions. Maps like the 1961 Town Plan of Enugu depict how Indigenous lands were restructured into colonial administrative zones, prioritizing industrial and political interests. A transcription of petitions and colonial correspondence on land dispossession and land rights claims reveals the determined efforts of Indigenous communities to contest the expropriation of their ancestral lands. These documents detail resistance strategies, including formal complaints, collective demands for restitution, and assertions of customary land ownership. Photographs of mining sites and laborers complement the textual records, illustrating the lived realities of dispossession and the environmental impacts of colonial extraction. Together, the collection showcases Indigenous resilience and agency in the face of systemic exploitation, shedding light on broader themes of colonial injustice and the fight for land rights.
